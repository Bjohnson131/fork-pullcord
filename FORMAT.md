Log format
==========

Logs are [TSV][] files. Records are delimited by line feeds.

There are three escape sequences:

    \t U+0009 CHARACTER TABULATION
    \n U+000A LINE FEED
    \\ U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS

All entries describe actions, i.e. each new message, edit or deletion is a
separate entry.

Fields common for all entries:

    action,type,id

All common fields are required. Unless specified otherwise, other fields can be
empty. Boolean fields contain their name if the value is true or are empty if
it's false.

`Action` can be one of `add`, `edit`, `del`. `Type` corresponds to the Discord
type, such as `message` or `reaction`. `Id` is the ID of the object or the
subject of the action, depending on the entry type.
